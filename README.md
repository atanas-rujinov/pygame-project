# ROBOARM Game

ROBOARM is a basic pygame game developed as part of a school project. The objective of the game is to dodge bombs, catch apples, and burn trash that falls from the sky. The game also includes features like storing players' usernames and high scores in a file and displaying the player's rank.

## Game Features

-   Dodge bombs: The player controls a character and must avoid touching the bombs that fall from the sky. If the character collides with a bomb, the game is over.
-   Catch apples: Apples also fall from the sky, and the player's task is to catch them. Catching apples increases the player's score.
-   Burn trash: Alongside bombs and apples, trash falls from the sky. The player can use the character's roboarm to burn the trash and earn additional points.
-   Username and high score storage: The game saves players' usernames and their high scores in a file. This allows players to keep track of their progress and compete with others.
-   Rank display: The game displays the player's rank based on their high score. Players can see how they compare to others who have played the game.

## Music

ROBOARM features the following background music tracks:

-   "What's the Difference Instrumental" by Dr. Dre ft. Xzibit

## Getting Started

To run the game, follow these steps:

1.  Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. ROBOARM was developed using Python 3.10.6, but it should work with newer versions as well.
    
2.  Install Pygame: ROBOARM utilizes the Pygame library. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:
    
    Copy code
    
    `pip install pygame` 
    
3.  Clone the repository: Clone the ROBOARM repository to your local machine using Git or by downloading the ZIP file.
    
4.  Run the game: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's directory, and run the following command:
    
    Copy code
    
    `python roboarm.py` 
    
5.  Enjoy the game: Once the game is running, use the arrow keys to move your character and dodge the bombs. Catch apples with Down Arrow to increase your score, and use the roboarm to burn falling trash with Up Arrow. Your username and high score will be saved automatically.
